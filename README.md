# Pattern Printer in C++

A **menu-driven program** that prints up to 15 different patterns based on user input.
Basically made to refresh my c++ concepts.

## Can print the following patterns:
- Right half pyramid                           
- Left half pyramid
- Full pyramid
- Inverted right half pyramid
- Inverted left half pyramid
- Inverted full pyramid
- Rhombus pattern
- Diamond pattern
- Hourglass pattern
- Hollow square pattern
- Hollow full pyramid
- Hollow inverted full pyramid
- Hollow diamond pyramid
- Floyd's traingle
- Pascal's triangle

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   `g++ pattern_printer.cpp -o pattern_printer`
